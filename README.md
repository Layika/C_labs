# C_labs
Simple programs written in C during the second semester.

NOTE: As this is done for academic course, code presented here is not *production quality*. It might contain weird design choices (like don't use the array notation to dereference a pointer/get element of array) or may lack proper input error handling.

NOTE 2: Task descriptions are in polish, copied from course page.
